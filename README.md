This program can be used to remove punctuation and revert all camelCase variable naming to regular text.


Can be run in the terminal by:

`python codeParser.py name/of/folders/with/codeToParse name/of/output/folder/`

Note: currently the parser is set to parse only files ending in .java if you would like to change this edit line 15.
